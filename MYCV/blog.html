                <h2>Q1. Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem) one styling the size of an element so that the
                    element
                    isresponsive ? why ?</h2>

                <div class="answers">
                    <p>Earlier versions of today’s browsers had limited features, and we had to consider how to work with —
                        or
                        around— those when designing and developing our sites. Static and adaptive layouts were commonplace,
                        and
                        our sites were designed to pixel perfection. </p> <br>
    
                    <p> There are a couple of reasons to use unitless scales. Of course we can set everything in pixels, but
                        if
                        we
                        want to make something responsive, we usually need to overwrite more values. And another, maybe more
                        important, reason: some people will have their browser font size set to something else than the
                        default
                        16px, for example people who are visually impaired. </p><br>
    
                    <p> The other reason for using responsive and unitless values in our CSS is for supporting our
                        users that rely on zooming. Our users need to be
                        able to zoom the viewport without loss of content or functionality, or restrictions imposed by CSS
                        values or viewport scaling settings.
                        Zooming allowed us users to zoom everything on the page by
                        scaling up and down proportionally depending on our preferences. But as browsers handle page zoom
                        for
                        us,
                        there is a difference in how the the UI appears when the page is zoomed depending on the weather the
                        default
                        browser size has been adjested as well. </p><br>
    
    
                    <p> Relative css units and unitless
                        values like (%,em, rem) are used in our css to meet the needs of ever-changing viewport sizes.
                        Since giving units in this way will enables us to zoom the viewport without loss of the content and
                        resize text without
                        being forced to scroll both horizontally and vertically to read the content. </p><br>
    
    
                    <p> Hence, I prefer to use rem for font-sizes, em for margins and paddings and px for borders. I still
                        use
                        pixels
                        when it comes to borders, because I usually want a border to be just a fine, 1px line.
                        By using em for margins and paddings, they will increase when you increase the font size of your
                        element: perfect responsiveness. Most times, a font size on a smartphone can be smaller than on a
                        larger
                        display. If you set a higher root size for the latter, everything will scale proportionally.</p>

                <h2>Q2. 16px is default browser width so what does it mean when we say 200px ? How does the browser
                    interprets that ? </h2>
                    <div class="answers">
                <p>
                    The CSS pixel is a ‘reference’ pixel, not a device pixel. But once one understands that a ‘px’ is
                    actually a
                    reference, not a device pixel, things make more sense. CSS px is an abstract unit and
                    there is a ratio controlling how it maps to actual device pixels and to physical units. </p><br>
                <p>
                    If the user zooms in, an element with width: 200px takes up more and more of the screen, and thus
                    becomes wider and wider when measured in device
                    (physical) pixels. In CSS pixels, however, the width remains 200px, and the zooming effect is
                    created by
                    expanding CSS pixels as much as is needed.</p><br>
<p>
                    Hence, unless the 200px is expressed in relational units like rem or em, the 200px will be rendered
                    as it is on the browser.
                    But is the 200px length is expressed in above mentioned relational units, the browser will render
                    the lenght in relation to the
                    16px default browser-font-size.

                    The 200px size is 12.5 times 16px size. Since the default 16px size is taken as 100% percent on the browser, the 
                    item with 200px size woould be rendered as being 12.5 times the size of the default length.

                <h2>Q3. Explain in detail(in technical terms) the specific changes in css3 </h2>
                <div class="answers">
                <p>
                    The biggest difference between CSS2 and CSS3 is that CSS3 is now split into different modules. Since
                    each module makes its way through the W3C individually, there’s a wider range of browser support.
                </p>
                <h3>Backword compatible</h3>
                <p>
                    
                    CSS3 is backword compatible with CSS2. It will not make any code written in CSS2 as invalid. it
                    makes
                    the look and feel of a webpage even better. They load faster and the time required to build a page
                    is
                    even
                    less.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Multiple Backgrounds
                </h3>
                <p>
                    

                    Background-image, background-position and background-repeat can now be used to specify multiple
                    background images to be layered on top of one another. The first image being closest to the user,
                    with
                    the following image layered behind. If there is a background color, it’s painted below all the image
                    layers.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    New Background Style Properties

                <p>
                    


                    Background-clip: how the background image should be clipped.
                    Background-origin: whether a background should be placed in the padding box, the border box, or the
                    content box.
                    Background-size: determines the size of the background image. This allows stretching smaller images
                    to
                    fit a page.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Box Sizing
                </h3>
                <p>
                    

                    Box-sizing allows developers to get the sizing of elements right without having to subtract
                    dimensions
                    for
                    padding and borders. With the box-sizing property, the padding and border are included in the height
                    and
                    width.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    RGBA colors
                </h3>
                <p>
                    

                    RGBA works just like RGB, except that it adds a fourth value: alpha, the opacity level or alpha
                    transparency
                    level. The first three values still represent red, green, and blue. For the alpha value, 1 means
                    fully
                    opaque, 0 is fully transparent, and 0.5 is 50% opaque. You can use any number between 0 and 1
                    inclusively.
                    HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. With HSL you can tweak either just the saturation or
                    the
                    lightness while keeping the same base hue.
                    OPacity sets the opaqueness of the element on which it’s declared, similar to alpha.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    2D and 3D transformations, animations, and transitions
                </h3>
                <p>
                   

                    These effects allow elements on a page to rotate, grow, shrink, flip, or translate into a different
                    color.
                    Elements created in CSS can move on screen without requiring any JavaScript or Flash
                    code. With transitions, an element can seamlessly change size and color. You can set a duration for
                    a
                    transition, e.g. creating a button that slowly expands and changes color when you mouse over it.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    FLEXBOX
                </h3>
                <p>
                   

                    The CSS3 flexbox feature makes it much easier for web developers to arrange HTML elements vertically
                    or
                    horizontally. Website layouts designed with flexbox can respond to users with various screen widths,
                    including mobile devices.
                </p>
                <h3>

                <p>
                   
                    Border Properties Borders are still what we’re used to (solid, double, dashed, etc.). Now you can
                    create
                    rounded corners.
                </p>
                <h3>

                </h3>
                <p>
                    

                    It provides the ability to add drop shadows to elements using the box-shadow property. This property
                    lets
                    you specify the color, height, width, blur, and offset of one or multiple inner and/or outer drop
                    shadows on
                    your elements.

                <h3>
                    Gradients
                </h3>
                <p>
                    

                    The linear-gradient() function sets a linear gradient as the background image.
                    To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. Color stops are the colors you
                    want to
                    render smooth transitions among.

                    Radial gradients are circular or elliptical gradients. Rather than proceeding along a straight axis,
                    colors blend out from a starting point in all directions.

                <p>
                   
                    text-shadow adds shadows to individual characters in text nodes.
                </p>
                <h3>

                <p>
                  Few powerful selectors have been introduced in css3 to make styling easier and specific.
